## Overview

The Coffee Machine project is a console-based Python application that emulates the functionality of a coffee vending machine. Users can choose from a selection of coffee drinks, and the program will manage resources, process payments, and dispense the chosen beverage accordingly.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program**: Execute the `CoffeeClone.py` script to start the coffee machine simulation.
2. **Select a Drink**: Choose from the available options (e.g., espresso, latte, cappuccino).
3. **Process Payment**: Insert the required amount of money as prompted.
4. **Enjoy Your Coffee**: If the payment is sufficient and resources are available, the program will dispense your chosen drink.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used to develop the application.

## Lessons Learned

Developing this project provided insights into:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Implementing classes and objects to model real-world entities like the coffee machine and its components.
- **Resource Management**: Tracking and updating the availability of ingredients required for each coffee type.
- **User Interaction**: Handling user inputs to navigate the menu and process transactions.
- **Error Handling**: Managing scenarios where resources are insufficient or payments are inadequate.
